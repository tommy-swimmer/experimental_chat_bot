Never memorize something that you can look up.
Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.
The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling but in rising every time we fall.
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking.
If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor.
If you look at what you have in life, you'll always have more. If you look at what you don't have in life, you'll never have enough.
If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
