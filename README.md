# experimental_chat_bot

This bot is made from the RealPython website article, titled "A Simple Guide to Making a Discord Bot Using Python" at the moment.
I'm too lazy to link it at the moment.

It can:
  - Run a .ping command which will respond with Pong! [latency].
  - Pick from a quote.txt file at random when prompted with the command .quote


# To-Do
- Make it useful
- Make it smarter
